                        using 2 pages.</li>

                        your resume in pdf format. You can convert this file to pdf in google docs by going to File,

                        numbers, so quantify as much as you can.</li>

                    <li class="company-item">Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2 lines. No recruiter will
                        read bullet points that are as long as paragraphs.</li>

                        Additionally, consider having someone else proofread it to prevent sending an imperfect resume.
